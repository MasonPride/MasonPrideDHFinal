        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This online resource aims to provide anyone who wishes to know more about the 'Joe Weiders Mr.Olympia Mens Classic Physique' with open access 
            to information on each years winner as well as the rest of the standings. The Classic Physique division was introduced to the Mr. Olympia competition in 2016
            to provide a platform for athletes with a more classic and aesthetic physique, reminiscent of the bodybuilders from the "Golden Age of Bodybuilding" (roughly the 1960s and 1970s). 
            This category emphasizes symmetry, proportion, and muscle definition while discouraging the extreme muscle mass that is often associated with some of the more contemporary 
            bodybuilding categories.Competitors in the Classic Physique division are judged not only on their muscular development but also on their presentation, posing, and overall aesthetic 
            appeal. Athletes are expected to display a balanced and harmonious physique that aligns with the traditional ideals of bodybuilding.</p>
